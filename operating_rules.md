# Operating Rules

## Overview
This document defines the operational guidelines, workflows, and quality standards for using the skills system. These rules ensure consistency, quality, and alignment with brand standards across all projects.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Brand Alignment First
- **Always** review relevant brand voice guidelines before generating content
- **Never** create content that violates `brand/do_not_do.md` restrictions
- **Ensure** output matches the appropriate brand voice (BizDeedz or Turea)

### 2. Quality Over Speed
- Take time to gather complete input information
- Don't rush outputs with incomplete context
- Verify accuracy of data, claims, and examples
- Proofread before finalizing

### 3. Customization is Key
- Default templates are starting points, not rigid requirements
- Adapt outputs to specific contexts and needs
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Tailor tone and detail level to audience

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Track what works and what doesn't
- Update skills based on feedback and results
- Refine templates as patterns emerge
- Document learnings for future reference

## Escalation & Exception Handling

### When to Seek Guidance
- **Unclear Requirements**: Can't determine user's actual need
- **Conflicting Guidelines**: Brand rules seem to contradict
- **Sensitive Content**: Legal, medical, financial, or controversial topics
- **Data Questions**: Uncertainty about facts or statistics
- **Scope Creep**: Request expanding beyond skill's purpose

### Exception Request Process
1. **Identify the Exception**: What guideline needs deviation?
2. **Explain the Rationale**: Why is exception necessary?
3. **Assess the Risk**: What could go wrong?
4. **Propose Alternative**: How to achieve goal within rules?
5. **Document Decision**: Record if exception is approved

### Red Line Rules (No Exceptions)
These rules have **zero** flexibility:
- No false or misleading information
- No prohibited content from `do_not_do.md`
- No privacy violations
- No plagiarism or IP theft
- No unethical practices
- No legal/medical/financial advice
