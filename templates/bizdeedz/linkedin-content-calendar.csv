WEEK 1: PROBLEM AWARENESS,,,,,,,,
Day,Date,Post Type,Theme,Hook (First Line),Main Content,CTA,Hashtags,Status
Monday,Week 1,Pain Point,Manual Work,"Your team spent 10 hours last week on data entry. Here's what that actually cost you:","Break down: 10 hrs x $35/hr = $350/week = $18K/year. But the real cost? Senior staff doing admin work instead of client work. That $18K becomes $50K+ in misallocated value.","Drop a fire emoji if your senior staff are doing work that software could handle.",#LegalOps #Automation #LawFirmManagement,Not Started
Wednesday,Week 1,Value,Quick Win,"Here's a 5-minute fix that saved my client 3 hours every week:","Set up automatic email filing in your practice management system. Most have this built in but turned off. [Step-by-step instructions]. This alone = 150+ hours/year recaptured.","What's one task you wish you could automate? Reply below.",#ProductivityTips #LegalTech #WorkflowAutomation,Not Started
Friday,Week 1,Story,Transformation,"I watched a paralegal cry last month. Not from sadness. From relief.","After 8 years of manually updating 47 spreadsheets every Friday (yes forty-seven) we automated the entire process. She got her Friday afternoons back. Sometimes the ROI isn't just money.","Share a time automation changed someone's work life.",#LegalLife #AutomationStory #WorkLifeBalance,Not Started

WEEK 2: CREDIBILITY BUILDING,,,,,,,,
Day,Date,Post Type,Theme,Hook (First Line),Main Content,CTA,Hashtags,Status
Monday,Week 2,Authority,Experience,"29 years in bankruptcy operations taught me something most consultants miss:","The best automation isn't always the newest tech. It's the right tech for YOUR workflow. I've seen firms waste $50K on 'solutions' that created more problems. The difference? Understanding the actual workflow before touching technology.","What's the biggest tech investment that didn't pay off for you?",#BankruptcyLaw #LegalOperations #Consulting,Not Started
Wednesday,Week 2,Value,Framework,"Want to know if your firm is ready for AI automation? Use the EDGE test:","E - Existing processes documented? D - Data in digital format? G - Goals clearly defined? E - Executive buy-in secured? Score yourself 0-2 on each. Under 5? You're not ready yet. 5-6? Start small. 7-8? You're primed for transformation.","Comment your score. I'll reply with a personalized tip.",#AIReadiness #LegalInnovation #DigitalTransformation,Not Started
Friday,Week 2,Social Proof,Results,"A trustee's office went from 'drowning' to 'cruise control' in 6 weeks.","Before: 3 staff working weekends to meet deadlines. After: Same work done by 2 people finishing by 4pm. The secret? We didn't add software. We removed 4 redundant steps they'd been doing 'because we always have.'","What process in your office has the most unnecessary steps?",#CaseStudy #ProcessImprovement #Efficiency,Not Started

WEEK 3: OBJECTION HANDLING,,,,,,,,
Day,Date,Post Type,Theme,Hook (First Line),Main Content,CTA,Hashtags,Status
Monday,Week 3,Myth Busting,Cost,"'We can't afford automation.' I hear this weekly. Let me reframe:","You can't afford NOT to automate. Quick math: If automation saves 10 hrs/week at $40/hr loaded cost = $20.8K/year. Even a $15K investment pays back in 9 months. After that? Pure profit.","What's the biggest perceived barrier to automation at your firm?",#ROI #InvestmentMindset #LegalBusiness,Not Started
Wednesday,Week 3,Value,Risk Mitigation,"3 compliance disasters I've seen that automation could have prevented:","1. Missed filing deadline = $25K penalty. 2. Wrong version sent to court = case dismissal. 3. HIPAA breach from email error = $100K+ settlement. Automation doesn't just save time. It saves your reputation.","What's your biggest compliance fear right now?",#ComplianceRisk #RiskManagement #LegalCompliance,Not Started
Friday,Week 3,Story,Journey,"I almost gave up on consulting 6 months in. Here's what changed:","Early clients wanted cheap and fast. I delivered expensive and thorough. Mismatch. Then I niched down to bankruptcy operations - MY world for 29 years. Suddenly I wasn't selling services. I was solving problems I'd lived.","What's your niche? Or are you still trying to serve everyone?",#ConsultingLife #Entrepreneurship #NicheDown,Not Started
