## Story 1: Leadership - [TITLE]

- "Describe your leadership style"
- "Give an example of building a high-performing team"

### SITUATION (Context - 15% of story)
*Where were you? What was the challenge? Set the stage.*

**Your Story:**


---

### ACTION (What You Did - 60% of story)
*Step by step, what did YOU do? Use "I" not "we"*

[Example:
"First, I conducted one-on-ones with every team member to understand their perspective. I discovered the real issue: a bottleneck in the review process where everything funneled through one manager.

Second, I redesigned the workflow to distribute review responsibilities based on case type. I trained three senior staff to become reviewers for their specialty areas.

Third, I implemented a visual tracking dashboard so everyone could see pipeline status in real-time. This created healthy competition and early warning for delays.

Fourth, I established weekly team huddles focused on blockers, not blame. This shifted the culture from finger-pointing to problem-solving."]
