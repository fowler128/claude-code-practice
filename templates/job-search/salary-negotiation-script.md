## Phase 1: Deflecting Early Salary Questions

### When Asked "What Are Your Salary Expectations?"

**In Application/Early Screen:**

> "I'm focused on finding the right opportunity and I'm confident we can find a number that works for both of us once we determine there's a mutual fit. I'm open to discussing compensation once I better understand the full scope of the role."

**If Pushed:**

> "Based on my research for this level and industry, I'm looking at a range of $[ASPIRATIONAL] to $[ASPIRATIONAL + 10%], depending on the total compensation structure. But I'm flexible based on the full package."

**If Asked Current Salary (note: illegal to require in many states):**

> "My current compensation isn't directly comparable because [different industry/structure/benefits]. I'm targeting $[TARGET] based on the market rate for this role and my experience level."

## Phase 2: Receiving the Offer

### The Pause (Critical)

When you receive a verbal offer, NEVER respond immediately. Use this script:

> "Thank you so much for this offer - I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to join [Company] and work with the team. I want to give this the consideration it deserves. When do you need my response?"

**If they want an answer immediately:**

> "I understand the timeline. I just need [24-48 hours] to review the details and discuss with my family. I'll have a definitive answer by [specific date/time]."

### Information Gathering

Before responding, confirm you have:

- [ ] Base salary

## Phase 3: The Counter-Offer

### Opening Your Counter

Call the recruiter/HR (don't email first). Use this framework:

> "Thanks again for the offer and for giving me time to consider it. I've done a thorough analysis and I'm very excited about the role. I do have a few areas I'd like to discuss to see if we can get to a package that works for everyone.

> Based on my research and experience level, I was hoping we could get closer to $[ASPIRATIONAL] on base salary. I'm bringing [X years of experience], [specific relevant skill], and [specific value prop]. I'm also hoping we can discuss [equity/sign-on/PTO - pick one other item]."

### Key Phrases to Use

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I need" | "I'm hoping we can" |
| "That's too low" | "I was expecting something closer to" |
| "I have another offer" | "I'm considering multiple opportunities" |
| "I can't accept that" | "Is there flexibility on..." |
| "You have to" | "Is it possible to" |

### If They Push Back

**On Base Salary:**

> "I understand there may be constraints on base salary. Would you be open to discussing a sign-on bonus to bridge the gap? I'm also open to discussing a performance review at [6 months] with potential salary adjustment."

**On Equity:**

> "I appreciate that the equity package has a set structure. Could we discuss additional shares or acceleration on vesting given the experience I'm bringing?"

**On Everything:**

> "I really want to make this work because I'm excited about the opportunity. What flexibility exists in the overall package? I'm open to creative solutions."

### Scenario A: Offer Below Your Walk-Away

> "Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely interested in this role, but the base salary is significantly below my expectations and what I'm seeing in the market for this level. Is there room to discuss a number closer to $[TARGET]? I want to find a way to make this work."

**If they can't move:**

> "I appreciate you looking into it. Unfortunately, at that level I wouldn't be able to accept. If anything changes or if there's a different role that might be a better fit, I'd love to continue the conversation."

### Scenario B: Offer at Your Target (Good Position)

> "Thank you - I'm pleased with the base salary. I'd like to discuss [equity/sign-on/PTO] to round out the package. Specifically, I was hoping for [specific request]. Is that something we can discuss?"

### Scenario C: Competing Offer

> "I want to be transparent with you. I'm also in final stages with another company. I prefer [this company] because [genuine reason], but the other offer is at $[X]. Is there any way to get closer to that number? I'd like to make a decision this week."

**Rules for competing offers:**
- Never lie about having one
- Don't share the company name unless asked and you're comfortable
- Focus on your preference for THIS company

### Scenario D: They Say "Final Offer"

> "I appreciate you sharing that. I'm still very interested in the role. Would you mind if I took [24 hours] to make a final decision? I want to make sure I can commit fully once I accept."

Then decide: accept, walk, or try one more time.
