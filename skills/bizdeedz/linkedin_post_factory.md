## Post Anatomy Deep Dive

3. **Question Hook**: "Why do most B2B companies waste 60% of their marketing budget?"
4. **Contrarian Hook**: "Everyone says 'follow up within 24 hours.' Here's why that's wrong."
5. **Personal Hook**: "I made a $50K mistake so you don't have to."

**Hook Criteria:**
- ✅ Specific (numbers, timeframes, names)

- ✅ Track what performs best
- ✅ Be consistent with posting schedule

### DON'T:

- ❌ Write walls of text
- ❌ Include links in post body (kills reach)
- ❌ Use too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ Post and ghost (respond to comments!)
- ❌ Ignore LinkedIn's native features
- ❌ Copy-paste across platforms without adaptation

## Optimization Tips

### Algorithm Factors
LinkedIn prioritizes posts with:
- **Dwell Time**: Keep readers on your post longer
- **Early Engagement**: First 60 minutes critical
- **Comments > Likes**: Aim for conversation
- **Personal Posts > Company Posts**: Use personal profile
- **Native Content**: No external links in post body

### Engagement Tactics
1. **Ask Questions**: End with question to prompt comments
2. **Respond Fast**: Reply to comments within first hour
3. **Tag Strategically**: Mention relevant people (sparingly)
4. **Post Timing**: Test your audience (typically Tue-Thu, 8-10am or 12-1pm)
5. **Engagement Pods**: Share with group for initial boost
6. **Employee Amplification**: Have team engage early

### Testing Framework
Track these metrics:
- **Impressions**: How many saw it
- **Engagement Rate**: (Likes + comments + shares) / impressions
- **Click-through Rate**: If CTA includes action
- **Quality of Comments**: Depth of discussion
- **Follower Growth**: Net new from post
- **Lead Generation**: DMs or conversions attributed

Test variables:
- Hook styles (stat vs story vs question)
- Post length (short vs long)
- Time of day
- Day of week
- Topic categories
- CTA types

## Examples

### Example 1: Case Study Post

**Primary Post:**
```
We helped a 150-person SaaS company go from 4% to 17% lead conversion in 90 days.

No extra ad spend. No new team members. Just smarter routing.

Their problem was classic:
Leads came in from 5 different sources (LinkedIn, email, contact form, chat, referrals). Everything went into one queue. Sales team picked randomly.

The results?
• Hot leads got cold waiting
• Cold leads got too much attention
• Nobody knew what was working

What we implemented:
✅ Automated lead scoring (fit + interest + timing)
✅ Smart routing rules (hot leads → phone within 4 hrs)
✅ Structured CRM notes (context for every follow-up)

The 90-day results:
• Conversion rate: 4% → 17% (4.25x improvement)
• Time to first touch: 2.1 days → 3.2 hours (16x faster)
• Sales team capacity: +40% (less time on dead ends)

The key insight:
Most companies optimize their lead GENERATION. The real leverage is in lead ROUTING. Getting the right leads to the right reps at the right time changes everything.

This is exactly what we help B2B companies implement. Curious about your lead routing? DM me "AUDIT" for a free assessment.

```

**Alternative Hooks:**
1. "What if I told you that 70% of your leads are going to waste? Not because they're bad leads..."
2. "17% conversion rate. Here's the embarrassing part: We didn't change ANYTHING about lead quality."
3. "The fastest way to boost revenue isn't getting more leads. It's fixing how you handle the ones you have."

**Twitter Thread:**
```
1/ We helped a SaaS company 4x their lead conversion in 90 days.

No extra ad spend. No new headcount.

Just one change to how they routed leads. 🧵

2/ The problem was simple but deadly:

5 lead sources → 1 queue → random selection

Hot leads waited days. Cold leads got hours of attention.

3/ We implemented 3 things:

• Lead scoring (0-100)
• Smart routing (hot leads → call in 4 hrs)
• CRM notes (context for follow-up)

4/ Results after 90 days:

• 4% → 17% conversion (4.25x)
• 2.1 days → 3.2 hrs first touch (16x faster)
• +40% team capacity

5/ The lesson:

Most optimize lead GENERATION.

The real leverage is lead ROUTING.

Right leads → right reps → right time = everything.

### Example 2: Insight Post

**Primary Post:**
```
Everyone says "follow up within 24 hours."

Here's why that's costing you deals:

Not all leads are created equal. Following up with everyone within 24 hours means:

❌ Hot leads wait 20 hours (they've moved on)
❌ Cold leads get too much attention (wasted time)
❌ Your team treats everyone the same (no prioritization)

The better approach: Tiered response times

🔥 HOT LEADS (score 80+)
Response time: 4 hours or less
Method: Phone call
Assignment: Senior rep

🔶 WARM LEADS (score 60-79)
Response time: 24 hours
Method: Personalized email
Assignment: Inside sales

❄️ COLD LEADS (score <60)
Response time: 1 week
Method: Automated nurture
Assignment: Marketing automation

The result?
Our clients who implement this see 2-3x higher conversion rates on their best leads while spending 40% less time on dead ends.

The principle: Not equal treatment—appropriate treatment.
