# AI Readiness Accelerator

**Get your firm AI-ready in 14 days. No risk. No guesswork.**

---

## The Problem

Law firms are being sold AI tools they can't actually use.

Your intake data is inconsistent. Your templates live in 6 different places. Your staff workflows exist only in people's heads. And nobody has thought through what happens when AI gives bad advice to a client.

Deploying AI on a broken foundation creates malpractice exposure, not efficiency.

## What You Get

In 10-14 days, you receive a complete decision package:

| Deliverable | What It Is |
|-------------|------------|
| **AI Readiness Scorecard** | Objective baseline across 6 dimensions: process maturity, data quality, knowledge systems, tooling, governance, and change capacity |
| **Prioritized Roadmap** | 30/60/90-day action plan sequenced by impact and effort |
| **Use-Case Portfolio** | 3-5 AI opportunities ranked by feasibility, ROI, and risk |
| **Governance Starter Kit** | Acceptable use policy, access controls, escalation rules, and audit requirements |

---

## How It Works

| Phase | Days | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Intake** | 0-2 | Secure data room setup, artifact collection, checklist completion |
| **Assessment** | 3-6 | Process walkthroughs, data profiling, systems inventory, staff interviews |
| **Analysis** | 7-9 | Use-case scoring, ROI modeling, risk mapping |
| **Delivery** | 10-12 | Scorecard presentation, roadmap walkthrough, governance review |
| **Decision** | 13-14 | Executive readout, next-step alignment |

---

## Best Fit

**Ideal client:**
- Bankruptcy, family law, estate planning, or high-volume civil practice
- 5-50 attorneys with paralegal/support staff
- Using practice management software (Clio, MyCase, PracticePanther, etc.)
- Current pain: intake bottlenecks, drafting delays, missed deadlines, or data chaos

**Not a fit:**
- Solo practitioners without support staff
- Firms with no existing practice management system
- Firms under active litigation holds affecting data access
